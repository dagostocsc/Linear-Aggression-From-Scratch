This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of Linear Regression from scratch using Python.
The notebook covers key concepts of regression analysis, including data preprocessing, gradient descent optimization, loss function minimization, and model evaluation.
The implementation avoids built-in machine learning libraries, focusing on understanding the core mathematics behind linear regression.
The dataset used for training and testing is provided in data.csv.
This project is ideal for those interested in learning the fundamentals of machine learning by building algorithms from first principles.
